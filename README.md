## GitHub Setup
We'll be using a **protected master branch**. 
What this means, is no user can commit or push directly to master. 
In order to make a change, you need to...
 1. Create a new branch off master
 2. Make your changes in that branch
 3. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to merge your change into master
 4. Request the review of someone you think can give a meaningful assessment of your changes
 5. Once that person has approved the PR, click **squash and merge** to merge your changes into masster

### General git notes

- Make many small commits, rather than a few big ones
- Use meaningful commit messages so it's easy to read through changes
